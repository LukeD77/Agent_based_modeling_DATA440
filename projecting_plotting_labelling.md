# Projecting, Plotting and Labelling Administrative Subdivisions

Below is my final output for the Liberia map that includes administrative subdivisions down to the second level. I changed the colors around because bright green was slightly more
joyful.

## Challenge question 1 and team challenge question
My next set of images is from the team challenge question. I first used data on the country eSwatini (formerly known as Swaziland), but I found trouble when the HDX database 
had only one file for the administrative subdivisions that was a .rar file. I could not figure out how to work with it, so I switched to another country: Madagascar.

Here are my three images for Madagascar from the three different data repositories. I used the same code for generating the graph for each.

[GADM dataset](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67921793/91250111-3d36da80-e726-11ea-9cb4-256ff9a6262b.png)

[HDX dataset](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67921793/91250134-49bb3300-e726-11ea-987b-aba4df4e4cf8.png)

[geoBoundaries dataset](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67921793/91250174-60fa2080-e726-11ea-99dd-6ed243bc7cc1.png)

Examining the different graphs, there were no clear differences between them, which infers that the datasets were all congruent with each other.
I looked into how these data were gathered and while I could not find where the GADM data were collected, I did find that the geoBoundaries data were from United Nations Office for the 
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. This was also the case for XDH, but this dataset also listed that the data the OCHA received were from the Madagascar BNGRC 
(National Disaster Management Agency).


## Challenge question 2
Below is my image output for challenge question 2. 

[Montserrado county](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67921793/91250471-1d53e680-e727-11ea-87f2-845caa8f5e20.png)


## Challenge question 3
Below is my image output for challenge question 3. As you can clearly see, it is not correct. I was able to move the boundary boxes to the correct positions and get madagascar loaded,
but I could not make the labels for the boxes plot only to the x,y coordinates instead of every county labeled. I also did not focus on Detail A and B graphs because I wanted to 
fix one thing at a time.
I would have continued to work on the problem but my tired headache told me to go to bed.
